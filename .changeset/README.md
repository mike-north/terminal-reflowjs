# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in your terminal
2. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of your changes (this will appear in the CHANGELOG)
4. Commit the generated changeset file

## What happens when you merge a PR with changesets?

When a PR with changeset files is merged to `main`:
1. A GitHub Action will create a "Version Packages" PR that:
   - Bumps the version in `package.json`
   - Updates `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes
2. When you merge that PR, another workflow will:
   - Publish the new version to npm
   - Create a GitHub Release with release notes
